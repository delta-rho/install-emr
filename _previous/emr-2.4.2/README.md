# Tessera Environment on Amazon EMR #

**Note:** This is deprecated.  Please see the scripts for [emr-3.2.1](https://github.com/tesseradata/install-emr/tree/master/emr-3.2.1).

## Prereqs ##

*   Comfortable installing software and using command line tools
*   An Amazon AWS Account (EMR is not available with the free usage tier)
    *   http://aws.amazon.com/
*   Install the Amazon EMR CLI
    *   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-cli-install.html
    *   When setting up your account always use the same region (e.g. "us-east-1")
    *   **Windows Users:**
        *   If the link on Amazon to install Ruby is broken use this one: http://rubyinstaller.org/
        *   The use of the Windows command prompt is required: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window
    *   **Follow all the instructions!**
    * This step will have you setup an S3 bucket and generate a key-pair that will be used below


## Instantiating a Cluster ##

*   Do a `git clone` of this repo or download the files as a zip (click the "Download ZIP" button on the right) from this github site and unzip them
*   Upload all `emr-2.4.2/install-*` scripts to your S3 Bucket (ignore the Rhipe-*tar.gz)
    *   This can be done through the AWS S3 web site
*   Copy the command below to your favorite text editor then replace `<bucket>` with your own S3 bucket (and path if different) and specify the key-pair you just made in the Amazon EMR install guide
*   Run the command from the command line (or DOS Prompt) on your local machine where you installed elastic-mapreduce as outlined in the install guide above
*   Linux/Mac
````

*   Windows Users:
    *   Run the following command from the DOS Prompt
    `ruby elastic-mapreduce <all the above arguments on a single line>`

You can monitor the progress on the EMR console
https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/vnext/home

## Post Instantiation Configuration ##

Currently there a few steps that have not been automated that need to be done manually when the cluster has finished provisioning
Once the cluster has been spun up (around 10 - 15 min) you can access the master node via ssh through the elastic-mapreduce CLI

*   Linux/Mac
`./elastic-mapreduce --ssh -j <job id from previous command>`
(if you are familiar with EC2 you can access the master node via the ip address and pem as well)
*   Windows Users:
    *   `ruby elastic-mapreduce -ssh -j <job id from previous command>`


### Open Ports ###

From the AWS EC2 web site, find the master node in the EC2 instance list and select the security group

*   Select the "Inbound" tab
* Click "Edit"
* Add "Custom TCP rule"
* "port range" = 8787
* "source" = your IP address OR Anywhere

Repeat for ports (check that the port are not already available first): 22, 9100, 9103

## Accessing RStudio ##

From your local machine, using the IP address or public DNS of the master node  (listed in the cluster details on the AWS EMR console page above) from a  web browser navigate to http://[master ip address]:8787
login as user3/user3

## Common Problems ##

*   Unable to ssh into master node:
    *   Verify that ssh port 22 is open in the security group for the master node as done above for rstudio above
    *   If using the elastic-mapreduce cli check that the credentials file has been setup and is named "credentials.json".  If using Windows, it may try to add a ".txt" extension to this file which will not work.
    *   If the elastic-mapreduce cli cannot find the key-pair named in the credentials file, make sure on AWS (EC2 -> key pair) the key-pair is in the same region as specified in the credentials file
*   Some corporate networks block Amazon AWS IP addresses. In this case you can only run R by ssh'ing in and running R from the command line or by using an alternate network

## Notes ##

*   This is based on Amazon AMI image 2.4.2.  More current AMIs come with R 3.x preinstalled and will be looked at in the future
*   Amazon Hadoop 1.0.3 comes with Google proto bufs 2.4.1
*   This script uses Rhipe 0.74 which depends on proto bufs 2.4.1
*   Rhipe 0.75 is based on proto bufs 2.5.0 and initial testing was unsuccessful even with prot bufs 2.5 manually installed

## Known Issues ##

*   "m1.large" or larger instance types must be used.  Smaller instance types have caused issues where hadoop is unable to start
